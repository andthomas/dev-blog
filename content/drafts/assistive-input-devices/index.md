We are not all able to use a computer with a conventional keyboard and mouse. Sometimes, our bodies just don't work in the way that a laptop, desktop, tablet or phone would normally require us to.
 
This is where assistive technology comes into play.
 
Going into this post I didn't know a thing about assistive technology, but was keen to learn more about how it fits the physical needs of its users, and the software which interprets these devices. Quickly though, I found out there is an absolute plethora of assistive technology, each specific to the needs of its user. So in the interests of brevity, this post is only about assistive input hardware.
 
### Head Tracking/Gaze Tracking
 
Chances are if you're reading this blog you've probably played with a Wii (I'm not accusing you of being a geek, although you're probably the first to admit that you are). Assistive tracking technology works in a similar fashion, only instead of a remote sending motion data to an infrared sensor, a camera tracks a point (or points) on a user which is translated into a position coordinate on a screen.
 
Head tracking requires a user to wear a reflective dot on their forehead or glasses, and for the tracking camera to be mounted on their device, facing towards them. Then, through a combination of their own software and existing mouse drivers, enables the user to control the mouse by moving their head. Head tracking technology is great for people with very restricted movement, and doesn't require the user to wear any bulky or uncomfortable devices. It is, however, pretty expensive stuff and may not always be compatible with the users device, or operating system.
 
Gaze tracking (or gaze interaction) works in a similar manner, however, instead of the user wearing a reflective dot on their head, a camera captures the movement of the users eyes. Additionally, the camera uses infrared light to illuminate the eyes and the camera captures the reflection off the retina and the cornea, referred to as ‚Äúred-eye‚Äù and ‚Äúthe glint‚Äù respectively. These points are used to build a 3D model of the users eyes to determine: where the users eyes are looking (the gaze point) and where the users eyes are in space relative to the computer (track box). Similarly to head tracking technology, gaze tracking is lightweight, and powerful for people with restricted body movement. Gaze tracking even goes a step further, and can be used by individuals who are unable to manoeuvre their head or neck. Gaze tracking does also run into compatibility issues, and is expensive technology.
 
 
### Head/Chin/Mouth Pointers
 
Head pointers are made up of an adjustable headband with a rod extension, to which a stylus can be attached. These are primarily used by people with very limited use of their hands/arms. The user maneuvers their head to point and operate their keyboard or touchscreen.

Some consider headpointers with forehead protrusions to be less accurate and more difficult to use than mouth pointers or chin pointers, as the placement of the stylus at the top of ones eyeline makes it difficult or even uncomfortable to see the screen.
 
A benefit of the head pointer as apposed to head-tracking devices is that they are agnostic to the device they operate and don't require software to be operational. They also don't use any power and are relatively cheap. However they are quite bulky and can be uncomfortable, and are more cumbersome to use than head or gaze tracking technology.
